# 'Statistical Analysis of Air Pollution Causes'

This GitHub repository contains all the code for the final project of the DSAN 5100 course at Georgetown University. The project was completed by Colin Campbell, Sazan Khalid, and Andrew Moy in the Fall of 2025. 

Since the focus of the code was to perform as much exploratory data analysis as possible, rather than creating a professional and modular code repository, very little time was spent organizing the code. Therefore, the code is separated into three branches (one for each individual) and was never pulled into the main branch.
